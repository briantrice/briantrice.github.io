== Objective == 

To broaden my experience as a software developer in dynamic languages and 
flexible applications, and to work on projects with significant technical and 
design challenges. 

== Skills == 

=== Programming Languages === 

==== Practical: ==== 

Smalltalk[3] (using Squeak[4], Dolphin[5], and VisualWorks[6], for web and 
desktop), Lisp[7]/CLOS (using CMUCL, SBCL, MCL for Unix server environments), 
ANSI C/C99, C++ (including templates), C#[8], Java[9], Objective-C[10], Perl, 
Pascal, PHP, ("Visual" and otherwise) Basic. 

==== Familiar: ==== 

Maude[11], Erlang/OTP[12], Self[13], Beta[14], Forth[15], Haskell[16], ProGraph
[17], Oberon[18]/Juice, J[19], ML[20], Clean[21], Joy[22], Ada[23], Cobol, 
PostScript, Tcl. 

==== Assembly & Machine Code: ==== 

Intel 80x86 family and Pentium series, IBM PowerPC family (603e and 750), 
Motorola(?) 6502 and 65c02, Motorola 68k, Sparc 9, Alpha, MIPS. 

=== Formats/Document Languages === 

(X)HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, XML, OWL/RDF, RSS, LaTeX. 

=== Software Environments: === 

==== Operating Systems: ==== 

- AppleDOS, MS-DOS, DOS4GW, Windows 3.1, 95, 98, NT, XP. 
- Linux, FreeBSD, BeOS, MacOS 8.0 - 9.1, NeXT and OpenSTEP, Mac OS X. 
- Language-based platforms are a favorite: Symbolics, Inc.[24] Genera 
Environment for Lisp Machines[25] (I personally own a MacIvory II[26]), Squeak
[27] Smalltalk[28]. 

==== Database ==== 

Intermediate Level of experience in development, design, deployment, 
user-testing, reporting, and requirements in: 

MS SQL Server[29] and VB 53 years experience in all roles of a traditional 
development team for client-server desktop applications for a large 
organization. PostGreSQL[30] database2 years experience in all roles. 

=== Subjects === 

==== Internet Applications ==== 

Intermediate levels of experience in: 

- Perl/PHP development in web services, for 3 years, for large scale 
database-backed sites with secure applications and large loads. 
- Lisp/Smalltalk development for interactive, intelligent, fault-tolerant web 
services, including dynamic template composition and cookieless stateful 
transaction support. 

==== Network Security ==== 

I've developed projects implementing advanced research for intrusion-detection 
technologies, as well as reporting tools and network management interfaces. 

==== C programming in systems and graphics ==== 

I spent a year (summer 1997 - spring 1998) developing a very high performance 
3-D graphics game engine for a proto-startup company, optimized for huge 
populations of data and intricate physics simulation detail. 

==== Compiler Development ==== 

I have developed over the years various frameworks for code-walking and 
optimization, for object-oriented and logical languages. 

==== CAD/CAM ==== 

I worked for several engineering firms in the early 90's, developing software 
in CAD development environments, and produced walk-through setups, engineering 
aids, and custom tooling software. 

=== Methodologies === 

==== Object-Oriented Programming: ==== 

- Refactoring[31] 
- Design Pattern[32] usage 
- UML[33] for design and documentation 
- Unit-test[34]-driven development.

== Experience == 

=== Software Design and Research Consultant === 



12/2002 - Present


Ibis Information Securities


Seattle, WA



Consulted in the development of innovative wireless technologies and the 
software required to manage them. Also consulted in the field of online 
data-mining in the systems security field. I designed and developed an 
innovative product using dynamic language technologies. 

=== Owner === 



5/2002 - Present


LOGOS Research and Development


Seattle, WA



Design, development, and testing of "Clean Slate" Smalltalk[35]: a new 
programming language and software architecture intended to demonstrate and 
bring up to date many technologies from various systems into one coherent 
whole. This will constitute a new kind of software platform which should be 
commercially viable within the year. 

The major aims of this project have been to deliver a new openly-available 
Smalltalk platform with enhanced semantics, development environment, and 
run-time characteristics while providing upwards compatibility with existing 
Smalltalk designs. 

This is a continuing development of 2 years of previous work and research 
development in the Common Lisp and Squeak Smalltalk open-source communities on 
compiler optimizations and environment design. 

=== Lead Developer === 



2/2001 - Present


ForeHorseNet, Inc.


Seattle, WA



Worked with the company founders to develop a coherent technical strategy for 
the product, by evaluating customer requirements, marketing issues, and 
suitable technologies and budgeting requirements. 

Developed PHP and JSP web applications, automated handling of XML meta-data, 
Java applets, designed the schema and developed it for a robust set of services 
over PostGreSQL and MySQL. 

=== Database Applications Programmer, Technician === 



3/1996 - 3/2002


U.S. Navy


Bremerton, WA



Electrical and electronics troubleshooting and repair, supervision and 
training, database applications programmer and administrator for the 
coordination of hundreds of work activities and information management. Managed 
a working group for equipment maintenance for over 2 years. Managed a system 
for equipment Quality Assurance, vibration monitoring, and software management 
for 2 years. 

Developed from scratch a database client-server setup with applications for the 
coordination and scheduling of activities and their dependencies for the 
nuclear and engineering sections of a nuclear aircraft carrier as well as its 
associated shipyard activity. This involved software requirements outlining, 
meetings with several entities along with study of the existing systems in 
effect, design, deployment, and user testing and feedback, and database and 
systems management. I also developed a prototype for a much more capable 
automation system using Dolphin Smalltalk which was eventually discarded to 
honor previous contract commitments. The system had several hundred users, with 
several layers of authorization and up to a dozen concurrent users in normal 
operation, along with an extensive reporting facility and mechanisms in place 
for assuring data accuracy and transaction logging. 

== Education == 

=== Independent Study === 

I have been educating myself over the years, accumulating quite a library and 
using it regularly. A selection of it is published online[36]. 

=== Professional === 



6/1996 - 1/1998


Naval Nuclear Power School


US-FL-Orlando



Completed the U.S. Navy's Nuclear Operator and Technician training program, 
involving physics, mathematics, and engineering examinations as well as 
applying the theory to operate a live power station. 

=== Some University Coursework Completed === 



5/1995 - 3/1996


Texas A&M University


US-TX-College Station



Completed two years of course work in engineering and mathematics, along with 
much independent study in computer science and mathematics, logic and 
philosophy. Dropped out due to financial issues at the time. 

During this time, I was a lab assistant for the engineering computing 
department, and employed as a tutor for mathematics and computer science quite 
successfully. I was also independently employed as a freelance software and 
systems troubleshooter for several engineering firms and accounting offices in 
the greater Houston area.

== Additional Information == 

I have been independently researching a very wide variety of computer science 
concepts and implementation techniques for the last 7 years. It is my intention 
to bring these together in a single comprehensive system that should provide an 
economically attractive next-generation computing platform. 

I delivered research papers to two conferences in 2002, Camp Smalltalk at 
OOPSLA[37] and the International Lisp Conference[38], detailing some of the 
steps toward this end. I also presented further results at the Smalltalk 
Solutions[39] conference in July, 2003. All were well-received.
