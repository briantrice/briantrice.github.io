    <h4>Documentation/Writing</h4>
    <p>I have developed API reference manuals and tutorials for several of my own packages as well as other open source packages. I have also participated in drafting a grant proposal to the State of Washington concerning technology resource.</p>
    <h4>Compiler Development</h4>
    <p>I have developed over the years various frameworks for code-walking and optimization, for object-oriented and logical languages.</p>
    <h4>CAD/CAM</h4>
    <p>I worked for several engineering firms in the early 90's, developing software in CAD development environments, and produced walk-through setups, engineering aids, and custom tooling software.</p>

<h2>Additional Information</h2>
    <p>I have been independently researching a very wide variety of computer science concepts and implementation techniques for the last 7 years. It is my intention to bring these together in a single comprehensive system that should provide an economically attractive next-generation computing platform.</p>
    <p>I delivered research papers to two conferences in 2002, Camp Smalltalk at <a href="http://oopsla.acm.org">OOPSLA</a> and the <a href="http://www.international-lisp-conference.org">International Lisp Conference</a>, detailing some of the steps toward this end. I also presented further results at the <a href="http://www.smalltalksolutions.com/">Smalltalk Solutions</a> conference in July, 2003. All were well-received.</p>
